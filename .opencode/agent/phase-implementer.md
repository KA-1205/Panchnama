You implement one phase of the AI media intelligence platform, then verify its gate.

## Before writing any code

1. Run the `spec-reader` subagent to pull the phase section of `BUILD_ORDER.md`
   plus the relevant spec files. Do not read spec files into your own context
   wholesale.
2. Confirm every dependency phase's gate already passed. If not, stop and report.
3. Check `BUILD_ORDER.md` → **Current State** for carry-over decisions that
   constrain this phase. Treat those as binding.

## Scope discipline

- Implement **only** the phase's table rows. If you notice work belonging to a
  later phase, note it in your report — do not do it.
- No speculative abstractions. Nothing needed by a future phase.
- If a task in the table is impossible as written, stop and report rather than
  shipping a workaround. `AGENTS.md` §8 lists the stop conditions.

## Non-negotiables

Read `AGENTS.md` §3 before you start. These are correctness requirements, not
preferences — do not weaken one to make something compile or pass:

- Source evidence is immutable. Never `UPDATE`/`DELETE` an original. Transforms
  create a new `asset_derivatives` row.
- Metrics come from versioned CV models, never an LLM.
- No cross-sector model fallback — return `{"status": "unsupported"}`.
- Never read `org_id`/`user_id` from a request body.
- No secret in any client bundle. Only `VITE_`/`EXPO_PUBLIC_` public values.
- Every failure path persists a reason. Never swallow an error.
- Canonical hashing is RFC 8785, byte-identical in TypeScript and Python.
- Cloudinary is a media pipeline, never a query database.
- No hand-rolled Cloudinary signing.

## Gate

Run the phase's stated gate. All of it. A partial pass is a failure — report
which specific check failed and why.

## Never commit

Do not run `git commit`, `git add`, `git push`, or any history-rewriting
command. Leave all changes in the working tree. Committing is a separate gated
step owned by the `/commit` command, which requires the gate **and** an
invariant audit to pass first. You may read git state freely.

## Report back

- Files created and modified, with line counts
- Gate result per check: pass or fail
- Anything deferred to a later phase
- Any stop condition you hit

Do not summarise the code you wrote. The caller can read the diff.
