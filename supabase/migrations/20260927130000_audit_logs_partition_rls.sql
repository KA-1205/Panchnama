-- Phase 1 — CRITICAL FIX: row-level security on audit_logs partitions
--
-- FINDING (P0, cross-tenant data leak + audit-trail forgery)
--
--   `audit_logs` is declared `PARTITION BY RANGE (hashed_at)` and
--   `audit_logs_default` is created as `PARTITION OF audit_logs DEFAULT` in
--   migration 070000. That migration then enabled RLS and added the
--   `audit_select_org` policy on the PARENT only.
--
--   In PostgreSQL a partition inherits the parent table's ACL — so
--   `anon` and `authenticated` received full SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/
--   TRUNCATE on `audit_logs_default` — but it does NOT inherit the parent's
--   RLS setting or its policies. The partition was therefore a real,
--   fully-privileged, RLS-free base table in the `public` schema, which
--   Supabase's PostgREST auto-exposes at /rest/v1/audit_logs_default.
--
--   Demonstrated against this schema before the fix:
--     * `anon`, with no JWT at all, read every audit row including the
--       `details` JSONB payload.
--     * `anon` INSERTED a forged row. RLS off means no INSERT policy is
--       required, so the append-only guarantee did not hold either.
--     * An Org A member read Org B's rows (2 rows via the partition vs the
--       1 row they correctly see through the parent).
--
--   Why the gate missed it: every test reads `audit_logs` through the parent,
--   where RLS works. Nothing queried a partition directly. A test suite that
--   only exercises the intended path cannot see a hole beside it.
--
--   Why it matters: audit_logs is the hash-chained evidence backbone
--   (append_audit_log / verify_audit_chain, AGENTS.md §3.8). Readable across
--   tenants it leaks actor ids and change details. Writable by anyone it lets
--   an unauthenticated caller rewrite or extend the chain, which is the single
--   worst outcome for an audit product.
--
-- FIX
--
--   1. A helper that applies the parent's RLS posture to any partition.
--   2. Apply it to the existing `audit_logs_default`.
--   3. Rewrite `add_audit_log_month` so every *future* partition is secured at
--      creation. Without this, next month's partition silently re-opens the hole.
--   4. Regression tests in supabase/tests/05_partition_rls.sql, including a
--      negative case for a freshly created partition.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Helper
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Applies the same posture the parent has: RLS on, one org-scoped SELECT
-- policy, and no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy at all (append-only, AGENTS.md
-- §3.8). The parent is deliberately not granted UPDATE, so a partition must
-- not be either.
--
-- The policy body must stay byte-identical to the parent's or the two diverge.
-- Keeping it in one function is what stops that.
