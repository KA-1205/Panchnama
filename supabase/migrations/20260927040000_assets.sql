-- Phase 1 — Assets (photos/videos from the capture app)
-- Source: docs/architecture/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md §Assets + §"New columns required".
--
-- SCHEMA ADDITIONS beyond the CREATE TABLE block in DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
-- (documented per AGENTS.md §8 — additive only, no evidence column mutated):
--   * verification / verified_at / quarantined_at / notes
--     The §Assets DDL block defines only `upload_status`, but the same doc's
--     "Legitimate asset updates" table, AGENTS.md §3.6 (`assets.verification =
--     'failed'`), ARCHITECTURE.md §329 (`verification != 'passed'`) and
--     BUILD_ORDER Phase 1 all reference a `verification` column plus `verified_at`.
--     `upload_status` is retained (api-contracts.md returns it) as the coarse
--     ingest state; `verification` is the three-state integrity result.
--   * The six "New columns required" fields (upload_started_at,
--     device_monotonic_ms, ntp_offset_seconds, signature_tier,
--     exif_verified_at, caption_verified_at) are folded into CREATE TABLE
--     rather than a follow-on ALTER, since this is the first migration to
--     create the table.
