"""Structured JSON logging for the ML service (BUILD_ORDER Phase 11 —
"Monitoring: Pino + structlog").

This mirrors the API's Pino setup: one JSON object per line, safe to ship to a
log aggregator. It is deliberately stdlib-only (no runtime dependency, fully
typed for ``mypy --strict``); a production swap to ``structlog`` + OpenTelemetry
is the documented upgrade path and needs a collector endpoint that only exists
in staging.

Two invariants match AGENTS.md §3.5:
  * the internal JWT (``Authorization`` header) is never logged — the request
    middleware logs only method, path, status, and duration;
  * GPS coordinates are PII and are never part of a log record here (the ML
    service receives signed URLs and model outputs, not raw device coordinates).
