"""Cloudinary + asset I/O for the ML service.

Two narrow ports keep the pipeline testable and keep the SSRF / signing rules
enforceable:

* :class:`AssetDownloader` fetches original bytes — always through the SSRF
  guard, only from a signed Cloudinary URL.
* :class:`DiffUploader` uploads the rendered diff PNG. The production
  implementation uses the Cloudinary Python SDK's ``uploader.upload`` with a
  signed request; signing is **never** hand-rolled (AGENTS.md §3.11), and the
  diff is a derivative (``type: upload``), never an authenticated original.

Neither port ever calls the Cloudinary Search / Admin resource API — Cloudinary
is a media pipeline, not a query database (§3.9).
