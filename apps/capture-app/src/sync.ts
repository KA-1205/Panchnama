/**
 * Sync engine (BUILD_ORDER Phase 4 "Sync engine").
 *
 * Drains the offline {@link CaptureQueue} against the network. In production it
 * is triggered by `@react-native-community/netinfo` reachability changes and
 * `expo-background-fetch`; here the trigger is a port so the drain logic is
 * testable. The engine is resumable and honest about failure (AGENTS.md §3.6,
 * §3.7):
 *  - It uploads only when the network is reachable.
 *  - Each attempt goes through `markSyncing`, which stamps `uploadStartedAt`
 *    before any bytes move.
 *  - A confirmed upload is `confirmed`; a server rejection is `rejected` with its
 *    reason and is never retried; an interrupted or thrown attempt returns to
 *    `queued` (resumable) and is never marked confirmed on a partial upload.
