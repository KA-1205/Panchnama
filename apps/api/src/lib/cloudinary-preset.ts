/**
 * `verified_capture` upload preset and evidence retention policy (BUILD_ORDER
 * Phase 5: "Preset setup" and "Retention").
 *
 * The capture app uploads through an UNSIGNED preset (AGENTS.md §3.5: the client
 * never holds the API secret). The preset therefore carries the server-side
 * guarantees that a client cannot be trusted to set itself:
 *  - `overwrite: false` + `invalidate: false` so a `public_id` (content-addressed
 *    `{org}/{project}/{sha256}`) can never be rewritten to point at other bytes
 *    (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2, AGENTS.md §3.1 — originals are immutable);
 *  - originals land as `type: authenticated` (delivery requires an SDK-signed URL);
 *  - an `allowed_formats` + `max_file_size` bound;
 *  - AI tagging (`categorization`/`detection`) at ingest so tags are copied into
 *    Postgres `observations`, never queried back from Cloudinary (§3.9);
 *  - the incoming webhook (`notification_url`) whose signature the API re-verifies.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for the preset shape. It is applied
 * to Cloudinary by `ensureUploadPreset` (Admin API — a permitted server-side
 * use, not a query) and asserted in tests without a live account.
