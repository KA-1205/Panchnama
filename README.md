> [!NOTE]
> Panchnama is built for **NGOs, governments, and sustainability organisations** that collect huge volumes of field media but cannot organise, verify, or report on it. It is an **evidence and measurement system**, not a DAM or a stock library. Media is stored on Cloudinary, but the product is the proof around it.

## 🔍 The problem

An NGO uploads 40,000 field photos from a six-month reforestation programme. Three months later a donor asks for evidence that 800 hectares were restored. What exists is a phone gallery: nobody can find the northern plots, nobody can prove the "after" photos were taken on the same ground as the "before" photos, and a hand-counted sapling number is impossible to audit.

| Failure | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| **Media is not evidence.** Edited, re-compressed, or re-captioned with no tamper signal | Every number built on it is disputable; reports get rejected |
| **Impact is unquantified.** "Look, trees!" | Donors fund outcomes, not photographs; counting is manual and unverifiable |
| **Nothing is traceable.** A figure cannot be traced to a photo, model, or version | A report cannot be defended under audit |

Panchnama closes all three: capture is **signed at the moment of the shutter**, change is **measured by a versioned model**, and every report carries a **hash chain** tying a number to a photograph, a model version, and a timestamp.

## ✨ Key features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Tamper-proof capture** | Mobile app creates immutable, git-like commits: SHA-256 file hash, Ed25519 device signature (Secure Enclave / Keystore), frozen EXIF, GPS accuracy, and dual timestamps |
| **Multi-sector intelligence** | One project can hold several observation types (e.g. water cleanup, road construction, mangrove planting), each with its own ML model, GPS clustering radius, and metrics schema |
| **AI change detection** | Per-type GPS pairing, then ML routing, then quantified metrics (hectares, counts, % change) plus visual diff overlays |
| **Video support (MVP)** | 30-second clips, auto thumbnails, keyframe extraction, keyframe-based change detection, synchronized diff player |
| **Audit-ready reports** | Template-based PDF/HTML with an integrity appendix (hash chain, signatures, timestamps, GPS accuracy); verification target is under 5 minutes |
| **Full traceability** | SHA-256 hash chain in audit logs, EXIF hash verification, caption signatures, GPS accuracy recording |

<details>
<summary><b>How Panchnama compares to a typical platform</b></summary>

<br>

| Typical platforms | Panchnama |
| --- | --- |
| Upload portal + AI tags | **Tamper-proof capture** + cryptographic proof |
| Manual before/after slider | **Auto GPS clustering** + quantified metrics (hectares, counts) |
| Searchable gallery | **Semantic search** + GPS accuracy and observation-type filters |
| Manual report compilation | **Template-based PDF** + video clips + integrity appendix |
| Trust-based evidence | **Audit-ready**: hash chain, signatures, dual timestamps, EXIF freeze |

## 🧠 How it works

```

1. **Capture:** the field worker picks project, observation type, and phase, then captures a photo or video (30 s max). The app freezes EXIF, records GPS and accuracy, and signs the commit with the device key.
2. **Upload:** straight to Cloudinary with the integrity claims (signature, GPS, caption signature, EXIF hash) in the `context` field.
3. **Ingest and verify:** a Cloudinary webhook hits the API, which independently re-verifies the signature, re-hashes the bytes, and re-canonicalizes EXIF (RFC 8785). The result is `pass`, `fail`, or `unknown`.
4. **AI enrichment:** the API queues an `ai-enrich` job; the ML service runs the sector model, and Cloudinary tagging output is copied into Postgres.
5. **Pairing:** a BullMQ `pair-assets` job runs every 5 minutes, clustering unpaired before/after assets per observation type by GPS radius and time.
6. **Change detection:** the ML service returns quantified metrics and a red-overlay diff image, with the `model_version` recorded. Sectors without a trained model return `unsupported`.
7. **Reports:** Handlebars + Puppeteer produce a self-contained artifact with a `sha256` manifest, so a finalized report renders offline forever.
8. **Delivery:** the dashboard shows change events, a diff slider, a map, and integrity cards. Original media needs a 5-minute auth token.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generative AI (Cloudinary remove / fill / recolor / restore) runs **only on derivative report assets**, never on source evidence. Originals keep their SHA-256, EXIF hash, and audit chain intact.

## ⚙️ Configuration and ML routing

Each project defines its **observation types**. Each type picks an ML model, a GPS clustering radius, and a phase field.

<details>
<summary><b>Example <code>projects.config</code></b></summary>

<br>

```json
{
  "name": "Restoration of Nature",
  "sector": "mixed",
  "config": {
    "observation_types": [
      { "type": "ganga_cleanup",     "label": "Ganga Cleanup",     "model": "water",          "gps_radius": 10, "phase_field": "cleanup_phase" },
      { "type": "road_construction", "label": "Road Construction", "model": "infrastructure", "gps_radius": 5,  "phase_field": "build_phase" },
      { "type": "mangrove_planting", "label": "Mangrove Planting", "model": "forestry",       "gps_radius": 5,  "phase_field": "planting_phase" }
    ],
    "report_template": "integrated_restoration_report",
    "gps_cluster_radius_default": 5
  }
}
```

Projects can nest through `parent_project_id` (recursive CTE for tree queries). Sub-projects separate teams, permissions, and reports; observation types separate activities and models.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> Models resolve from the `model_registry` table. A sector with no trained model returns `unsupported` and is **never** served by another sector's model, because a wrong-sector number in a donor report is a credibility failure.

| Model key | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| `forestry` | Registered as `trained`, but a **placeholder: no weights exist yet** |
| `water` | `unsupported` |
| `infrastructure` | `unsupported` |
| `agriculture` | `unsupported` |

## 🔐 Security and integrity

| Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| EXIF edited before upload | Frozen at capture, hash verified server-side |
| GPS spoofed | Accuracy and provider recorded, dual timestamps |
| Caption added after capture | Signed at capture with the device Ed25519 key |
| File swapped | Content-addressable storage (SHA-256) |
| Backdated capture | Device and server timestamps both recorded |
| App tampering | Code signing (Expo EAS) + hardware-backed keys |

- **Immutable hash chain:** `current_hash = SHA256(previous_hash + action + actor + timestamp)` in `audit_logs`.
- **Verification:** `verify_asset_integrity(asset_id)` returns five checks (EXIF hash, SHA-256 match, caption signature, sync delay, audit chain), each `pass`, `fail`, or `unknown`.
- **Clock skew:** without a signed NTP offset the check returns `unknown`, never `pass`.
- **Compliance:** org-scoped Row Level Security on all tables, data minimisation, deletion via `upload_status = 'deleted'`.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does the capture app work offline?</b></summary>

<br>

Yes. Commits are stored in encrypted MMKV locally and queued for upload. Background sync via `expo-background-fetch` resumes when connectivity returns.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if GPS accuracy is poor?</b></summary>

<br>

The threshold is configurable (default 10 m). The app shows live accuracy and disables the capture button above the threshold. Accuracy is stored with each asset for downstream filtering.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if the ML model is wrong?</b></summary>

<br>

Every detection returns a confidence score. Low-confidence events are flagged for human review, the dashboard shows confidence badges, and manual override is possible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if Cloudinary goes down?</b></summary>

<br>

The capture app queues locally, and Supabase, Redis, and the API run independently. Cloudinary is only needed for upload, transformation, and delivery, not for auth or data integrity.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can we add a new sector later?</b></summary>

<br>

Yes. Add a new `SectorModel` class, register it in `SECTOR_MODELS`, and add a project config with the new `observation_type`. No platform code changes are needed.

</details>
